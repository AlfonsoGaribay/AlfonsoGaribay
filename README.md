### Design-minded engineer focused on interfaces, systems, and product thinking

## About

I’m a design-minded engineer interested in building thoughtful digital interfaces and product experiences.

My background in computer engineering shapes how I approach design and development, especially when thinking about systems, constraints, and technical feasibility. I’ve worked across iOS, front-end development, and interface design, often focusing on how products should behave as much as how they look.

In recent years, I’ve spent a lot of time refining design work — exploring layouts, interaction patterns, and UI systems — with implementation always in mind, even when projects aren’t fully deployed. I enjoy learning by building, iterating, and documenting decisions along the way.

I’m drawn to work where design clarity, technical reasoning, and user experience intersect, and I’m continuing to grow in environments that value craft, curiosity, and collaboration.
